	<h4>Intent</h4>
		<p>This website was designed to provide an interactive comparison of salaries, taxable benefits, and the employee reviews across Ontario&nbsp;public sector employers.<br class="" />The intent is to highlight the differences and longitudinal dynamics between earnings and proportion of male and female employees as&nbsp;well as their roles in the organizations.</p>
		<p><br class="" />Of course, it would be most meaningful to view this kind of analysis on Ontario's making regular (below $100,000 annual) salaries.&nbsp;However and unfortunately, only salaries of the highest earners are available at the present time.&nbsp;The trends we see here are most likely&nbsp;indicative of the overall trends we would see for wider public sector employees.<br class="" /></p>
	<h4>Data Sources & Technology</h4>
		<p>Data presented on the dashboard was obtained from the Ministry of Finance (<a class="" href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/public-sector-salary-disclosure">https://www.ontario.ca/page/public-sector-salary-disclosure</a>).<br class="" /><br class="" />Additional data was scraped from&nbsp;indeed.com&nbsp;(April 2019).&nbsp;Ratings information is static and will not be updated as ratings fluctuate over&nbsp;time.&nbsp;<br class="" /><br class="" />Technology used: Python programing language, Flask web micro-framework, Plotly Dash library, as well as multiple python libraries such&nbsp;as numpy, pandas, BeautifulSoup, etc.&nbsp;The conversion of names into genders was done with the help of gender_guesser&nbsp;(https://pypi.org/project/gender-guesser/)<br class="" /><br class="" />All rights reserved.&nbsp;This dashboard is available for free use and reference.&nbsp;It is intended to be used as a general informational tool and&nbsp;should not be used to inform decision making at the employer level.
