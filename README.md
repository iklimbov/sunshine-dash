# sunshine-dash
Plotly dash based on 2018 Sunshine Ontario list and some Ratings from job boards.
This application is currently deployed on AWS ec2 here (http://ec2-3-14-79-164.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/apps/db_app2)

Current issues (when running on free ec2) is that the second tab doesn't display histogram for the full set of data.  That is due to the volume of records.  If more restrictive parameters are set, it works fine.  This is not a problem while running on localhost.
